VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.

The binaries included in this package are downloaded from the official GitHub releases:
https://github.com/Polar-Team/diffusion/releases

The package downloads binaries directly from GitHub releases during installation,
ensuring that users always get the official, signed releases.

All releases are:
- Signed with Cosign (keyless)
- Include SLSA Level 3 provenance
- Have SHA256 checksums published

## Automatic Verification During Installation

The Chocolatey install script automatically performs the following verifications:

1. **SHA256 Checksum** (always): Verified by Chocolatey during download
2. **Cosign Signature** (if cosign is installed): Automatically verified against GitHub's OIDC
3. **SLSA Level 3 Provenance** (if slsa-verifier is installed): Automatically verified

To enable full automatic verification, install the verification tools:
```powershell
# Install Cosign for signature verification
choco install cosign

# Install SLSA verifier for provenance verification
# Download from: https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier/releases
```

## Manual Verification

To verify the binaries manually:

1. Download the archive from: https://github.com/Polar-Team/diffusion/releases
2. Verify the checksum against SHA256SUMS file
3. Verify the Cosign signature:
   ```powershell
   cosign verify-blob `
     --certificate diffusion-windows-amd64.zip.pem `
     --signature diffusion-windows-amd64.zip.sig `
     --certificate-identity-regexp="https://github.com/Polar-Team/diffusion" `
     --certificate-oidc-issuer="https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" `
     diffusion-windows-amd64.zip
   ```
4. Verify SLSA provenance:
   ```powershell
   slsa-verifier verify-artifact diffusion-windows-amd64.zip `
     --provenance-path multiple.intoto.jsonl `
     --source-uri github.com/Polar-Team/diffusion `
     --source-tag v<VERSION>
   ```
